                        Quite a few things have happened since my last post.
                        After traveling by bike, visiting interesting spots around the city, seeing
                        a rave, along with other events, this week has been packed with activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Early this week, we went on a guided bike tour throughout
                        the city. It's always crazy to see how many bicycles and how few cars
                        are in Copenhagen. I really liked the tour with how the Swedish guide talked
                        to us about the current politics in Scandinavia (though she may have been a little biased toward
                        Sweden).
                        I now understand how safe and efficient biking is for the city (only 1 fatal wreck in every
                        2 years), and it was cool to see how bikes have their own roads.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Friday, we drove to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aarhus">Aarhus</a> to have a
                        technical talk with a Google software engineer. After the talk, we explored the city and visited
                        some incredibly modern and interactive art museums. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of museums,
                        but these
                        places are must-sees for anyone.

                        One night this weekend, some of us went to a bar to play pool which was a fun experience.
                        After the bar, a couple of friends and I went to a rave to see Slow Magic. I was excited to
                        see this artist since I've listened to his music back home. The show was pretty crazy once
                        it started, and he played plenty of drums and electronic music throughout.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This week, I will be going to the Distortion music festival in Copenhagen, visiting
                        Sweden, along with a bunch of other fun activities.

                        After two delays and plenty of confusing French, it's safe to say that the flights were a
                        <q>success</q>. Sarcasm aside, the international flight was not like anything I've ever
                        experienced. They had various entertainment options to choose from along with plenty of free
                        drinks and food.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I finally arrived to the Copenhagen airport, I was surprised with their nice, mall-like
                        airport. We were greeted by DIS and taken by bus to our housing locations. The rooms are very
                        spacious and there's always something buzzing about the city. With little sleep from the flight,
                        I took advantage of the first night to sleep early and explore more the following day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The culture of Copenhagen slightly shocked me at first in two things: how nice and conserved the
                        Danes are. I really enjoy talking to them even if they don't realize that I can't speak back to
                        them in Danish. The people here are nice whenever you don't look <i>too</i> much like
                        an American tourist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, it's been a great arrival, and I'm looking forward to seeing what else the
                        city has to offer.

                        Welcome to my travel blog for my trip to Copenhagen! In just a couple of days, I am leaving for
                        this
                        study
                        abroad trip, and I can't
                        wait to share my experiences on this site.

                        Currently, this site features an aerial view of Copenhagen as well as a changing background.
                        The background depicts the vibrant colors of <a target='_blank'

                        I am particularly excited about this course since we will focus on both
                        front end and back end web development. My goal for this website is to make it as efficient
                        as possible in order to provide an interactive experience for the user.

                        With that said, be on the lookout for updates to this blog as it will continue to improve
                        during the course!
