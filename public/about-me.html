                    Hello, and welcome to my travel blog site! My name's Austin, and I am a junior computer
                    science major at UNC-Chapel Hill. For three weeks, I will be located in the beautiful city
                    of Copenhagen
                    as part of a study abroad program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To give some insight about my background at UNC, I've worked as a Learning Assistant for COMP 401
                    as well as a Research Assistant for Dr. Gary Bishop and enabling technologies. I am involved in a
                    few clubs at UNC, and
                    the one that I cherish the most is the Enabling Technology Club. I serve as the Vice
                    President and Treasurer where we promote the creation and use of enabling technologies. I am also
                    involved in DevApp and Buckley Public Service Scholars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This summer, I will be working as a JMP Technical Intern at SAS to update scripts for the
                    documentation team's software. I'm excited to start this position as soon as I return home
                    from Copenhagen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With prior web dev experience, I can't wait to learn more about the interactive components of a
                    website
                    that are not visible to users. Some of my previous projects include the following sites:
                    <ul class="about-list">
                        <li>&bull; <a href="https://austinbhale.com">austinbhale.com</a></li>
                        <li>&bull; <a href="https://sydneybhale.com">sydneybhale.com</a></li>
                        <li>&bull; <a href="https://hacknc.com">hacknc.com</a></li>
                        <li>&bull; <a href="http://edwardtrentzsch.github.io">edwardtrentzsch.github.io</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although I have never traveled outside of the country, I am confident that Copenhagen will
                    be an amazing trip. By learning more about Scandinavian culture and web development,
                    I plan to take these experiences and apply them to everyday life back home.
